# [TechNotes](https://github.com/Chromosom3/TechNotes/wiki)
This repository will be used to store notes for my classes under the wiki section as well as any scrips that I create for class. This repo may also be used to showcase projects that I work on outside of class. Use [this](https://github.com/Chromosom3/TechNotes/wiki) like to view the wiki. 

# [Public Scripts](https://github.com/Chromosom3/TechNotes/tree/main/public-scripts)
This directory houses a collection of scripts from a private repo that I need publicly accessible. These may not be the most up to date versions of the scripts from the private repository.
